# Three.js Megan

- Please keep your web browser console open to see the logs.

- I tried to describe through all my comnments my approach and shared examples, documentations I was working with.

- At this time, I'm not done with the .rts to animation clip part still WIP. See in `animation.js` the `buildAnimationClip()` function. I think something is wrong with my `new QuaternionKeyframeTrack` and the duration + values given on initialising a new KeyFrameTrack.
